# K-scaffold Tutorial
This tutorial is intended to demonstrate how to use the K-scaffold to build a character sheet on Roll20 and was originally written as a series of blog posts. The tutorial is split up into several files reflecting the state of the code at the end of each blog post. Once the tutorial sheet is completed, it will be in a folder called `final_code`. The code is left in the multiple states to demonstrate how a character sheet's code evolves over the course of a project. To start your own project, it is recommended that you download the current version of the K-scaffold from the [template v2 directory](https://github.com/Kurohyou/Roll20-Snippets/tree/main/K_Scaffold/Template%20v2).
